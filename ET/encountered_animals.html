    Porcupine
    </h1>
    <p>
     Porcupines are a mammal that is often considered a rodent.
<br>
      Porcupines are 2 to 3 feet long in their head and body. Their tails can be another 8 to 10 inches long.
<br>
      They weigh 12 to 35 pounds.
<br>
      To communicate they make grunts and high pitched noises.
 <br>
      A group of porcupines is called a family.
<br>
      Porcupines have soft hair mixed with sharp quills.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Snapping Turtle
    </h1>
    <p>
     They have powerful jaws and have an average bite force of 209 N. They may not have the same force that you do when you bite with your molars (1300 N) but they have enough force to do some real damage.
<br>
      The Common Snapping turtle is an aquatic turtle that prefers slow-moving, shallow bodies of water with muddy bottoms, which give them places to hide.
<br>
      They are omnivores, meaning they eat plants and animals.  Their diet consists of plants, insects, worms, snakes, fish and other small animals.
<br>
      You can find the Common Snapping Turtle all the way from southeastern Canada to the southern tip of the Florida panhandle.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Wolf
    </h1>
    <p>
     The average weight for a female wolf is 60 - 80 pounds.
      <br>
     The average weight for a male wolf is 70 - 110 pounds.
      <br>
     The life span of a wolf is up to 13 years in the wild and 16 years in captivity.
      <br>
     The average foot size for a wolf is 4 inches by 5 inches long.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Skunk
    </h1>
    <p>
     A skunk's sulfuric spray has a range of up to 10 feet, and its odor can be detected up to 1.5 miles.
<br>s
      Skunks eat wasps and honeybees, and will often attack beehives.
<br>
      Immune to snake venom, skunks are known to eat poisonous snakes like rattlesnakes.
<br>
      Although skunks have very poor eyesight, they have excellent senses of smell and hearing.
<br>
      A group of skunks is called a surfeit.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Squirrel
    </h1>
    <p>
     In Greek, the word squirrel means shadow tail.
<br>
      The most iconic behavior of squirrels is storing nuts and acorns for winter. Which is necessary for the species of squirrel that do not hibernate.
<br>
      The hind legs of squirrels are double-jointed, which gives them the ability to run up and trees very quickly.
<br>
      A male squirrel can actually smell a female in heat, from up to a mile away.
<br>
      Mating season for squirrels is from February to May, with a 44-day gestation period. Generally, two to four young are born per litter.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Foolbirds
    </h1>
    <p>
     The foolbird's real name is Canadian ruffed grouse.
<br>

<br>      
Average weight: 500 grams
<br>
      Life expectancy: Average less than 1 year; birds that survive their first year often live 2-3 years
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Rabbit
    </h1>
    <p>
     To express happiness, bunnies will sometimes jump around and flick their heads and feet. That adorable behavior is known within the rabbit community as a “binky.”  
<br>
 Like deer, a female rabbit is called a “doe” and a male rabbit is called a “buck.”
<br>
A bunny’s big ears aren’t just for listening! They also help regulate the rabbit’s body temperatures. The ears’ blood vessels swell when it’s hot out, and contract when it’s cold.
<br>
AND those amazing ears can also be rotated almost a full circle to 270 degrees.
<br>
To some, rabbits might seem like quiet pets, but they’re actually capable of making a lot of sounds, including growling, screeching, chattering their teeth, and even honking softly! Talk about adorable! 
<br>
Rabbits need large cages or exercise pens kept indoors for health, safety and socialization purposes! And, they need plenty of daily supervised time outside of their cages or pens to play and exercise. Be sure to bunny-proof your home and do not leave them unattended during this time. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Bear
    </h1>
    <p>
     Sloth bears are the only bears that are more active at night.
<br>
      Polar bears have a thick coat with 9,677 hairs per square inch.
<br>
      Most bears are born without fur. Only polar bears and giant pandas are born with thin white fur.
<br>
      Bears have non-retractable claws like dogs and unlike cats.
<br>
      While most bears have bare feet, the paws of polar bears have fur on the bottoms and between the toes. Bears lose most of their heat from their paws.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">
    Moose
    </h1>
    <p>
     Moose can travel at speeds up to 35mph, and can trot steadily for 32 km in just an hour.
<br>
      Despite their size and weight, moose are very adept swimmers. They are able to swim for several miles and can even be totally submerged under the water for around 30 seconds.
<br>
      The global moose population is estimated to be over 2 million, with the largest population being found in Canada.
<br>
      The name ‘moose’ is believed to originate from ‘mus’ and ‘moos’ which mean ‘eater of twigs’ or ‘he who strips of the bark’ in the Algonquian North American Indian family of languages. The name is apt given that moose are browsers rather than grazers.
<br>
      The moose is the official state animal of Maine in the USA.
